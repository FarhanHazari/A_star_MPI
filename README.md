# A* MPI

## How to run

> Execute the scripts

```bash
run/./batch_script.sh
```

This will create multiple sub scripts which will run our a_star program on the cluster with different parameters (such as the dimension of the grid and the nb of cores used).
Each sub scripts will be executed 10 times in order to get a better idea of the performance.
